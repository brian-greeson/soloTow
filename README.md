### Motor Bits
An average weight pilot will need a 3KW motor minimum. For example: I'm an 80kg pilot flying a moderatly fast glider. I use the 4.5KW motor listed below and it works great. Heavier pilots should consider getting a 6KW or higher motor.

| 1 | [Brushless Hub Motor](https://kellycontroller.com/shop/brushless-hub-motor-13in/) | $479.00 | Select the 72 volt and at least the 4.5KW |
| 1 | [Motor Controller](https://kellycontroller.com/shop/kls-n/) | $229 | Select the KLS7230ND | 
| **Total** | | **$708.00** | |
### Battery
You can select either a 60 volt or 72 volt battery. If you are regularaly towing with zero wind or at higher altitudes or I would recommend the 72 volt option as it will give you a slightly higher top speed. Lower elevations and average weight pilots will be fine with the 60 volt option. Be cautious with purchasing from vendors other than the ones listed here. Battery scams are rampant on aliexpress. I have purchased several batteries from this vendor and RMA a bad pack. The customer service was slow but good. After shipping the defective pack back I recieved a new pack within a week.

### Frame
The Frame is made of easy to source aluminum extrusion. I highly reccommend purchasing the frame parts pre-cut and pre-drilled. The extra cost is negligible and it will save you a lot of time and frustration.
